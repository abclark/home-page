<h2>Aubrey Clark</h2>
<p>I build machine learning systems. Trained as an economist, I now work on infrastructure, optimization, and adversarial ML.</p>

<p>I'm a data scientist and technical lead at Google, working on predictive maintenance, capacity planning, and congestion control for Google's global network infrastructure. Previously I was at Twitter (serving stack optimization, spam detection) and Wealthfront (automated financial planning). I did my PhD in economics at Harvard, where I worked on mechanism design with Eric Maskin.</p>
