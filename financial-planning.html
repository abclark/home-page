<h3>Financial Planning in the AI Era</h3>
<p><em>Log of a week spent teaching an AI to manage my money.</em></p>
<p>Background: I spent three years at Wealthfront building a <a href="https://www.ryantolsma.com/thoughts/2021/10/25/nested-benders.html">robo-advisor</a> — a stochastic optimization engine that planned 250,000 users' financial lives. We modeled every account type, tax rule, and contribution limit. Five years later I tried replacing the idea with an AI and a folder of bank statements.</p>

<h4>Feb 11</h4>
<p>Set up an AI assistant on a Raspberry Pi. Email, calendar, grocery list. The plumbing. What I actually wanted: feed it every account, every paycheck, every tax return, and have it tell me what to do.</p>

<h4>Feb 12</h4>
<p>Exported 50,000 WhatsApp messages and 4,500 iMessages from SQLite. Not about finance — about building enough context that the advice would be personal, not generic.</p>

<h4>Feb 13</h4>
<p>Financial data went in. Private GitHub repo with CSVs from Vanguard, Schwab, Chase, Capital One, Venmo. Portfolio positions, transaction histories, RSU vesting schedules.</p>
<p>First pass: net worth ~$1.6M including unvested stock. 70% of liquid assets in three tech stocks. Contributing to a 529 at a rate that assumes children I don't have. Connected a Wahoo bike computer. Set up cron jobs to sync repos daily and update prices weekly.</p>

<h4>Feb 14</h4>
<p>Drove to Tahoe. In the car, had the AI audit my public profile. It found my 2007 Australian election candidacy (455 votes, age 20), my Harvard dissertation committee, and a ZoomInfo profile with my work email. Started a cleanup.</p>
<p>Also had it draft job search materials — target companies, outreach templates, interview prep. All in files, nothing sent.</p>

<h4>Feb 15</h4>
<p>Backcountry skiing near Donner Summit. Tested voice dictation to the AI through Telegram while standing in snow. Worked. Added 21 birthdays to Google Calendar.</p>

<h4>Feb 16</h4>
<p>Forwarded compensation letters, W-2s, tax returns, Social Security statement. The AI extracted every line item and built a dashboard.</p>
<p>Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>401k was 56% Roth, 37% pre-tax. Wrong election for years.</li>
<li>$10,429 stuck in after-tax 401k — should have been converted to Roth IRA months ago.</li>
<li>W-4 set to Single/$0 additional. RSU income withheld at 22% against a 35% marginal rate. Under-withheld ~$15,000/year. Explained the April surprise every year.</li>
<li>$562 in credit card interest over two years. Not broke — 401k contributions are front-loaded, creating a winter cash crunch.</li>
<li>Unclaimed employer perks: free Goldman Sachs financial consulting, $1,200/year education reimbursement, $17/month ClassPass.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Feb 17</h4>
<p>Settled pre-tax vs Roth. The whole debate is one inequality.</p>
<p>You have $1 of pre-tax income. Two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-tax: $1 × (1+r)<sup>n</sup> × (1 − τ<sub>f</sub>)</li>
<li>Roth: $1 × (1 − τ<sub>n</sub>) × (1+r)<sup>n</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Growth cancels. Pre-tax wins iff τ<sub>n</sub> > τ<sub>f</sub>. Returns, inflation, time horizon — all irrelevant.</p>
<p>My τ<sub>n</sub> = 46.65%. To find τ<sub>f</sub>: project the pre-tax balance at real return, add Social Security, subtract standard deduction, apply today's brackets. Works exactly because brackets are inflation-indexed. My retirement income lands in the 12% bracket. Gap is 30 points.</p>
<p>Crossover: need $3.1M in pre-tax to make Roth competitive. IRS caps contributions at $24,500/year. Max that for 28 years and you get $1.6M. Half the crossover. The cap makes it impossible to overshoot.</p>
<p>Connected Chase to Plaid — it had blocked every previous attempt. Built a cash-flow monitor that checks balances against upcoming auto-pay dates and alerts me before a payment bounces.</p>
