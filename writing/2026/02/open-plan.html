<h2>Open Plan: One Folder That Turns Any AI Into Your Financial Planner</h2>

<p>Most people know they should "get their finances in order" but don't know where to start. The tools that exist are either too simple (budget apps that track spending but don't tell you what to do) or too complex (financial advisors who charge 1% of assets to rebalance a portfolio). The middle ground, a system that actually diagnoses your situation and tells you what to fix, doesn't exist as software.</p>

<p>So I built it as a set of text files.</p>

<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>Open Plan is a folder of markdown files. Copy it into any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, a local model) and say "help me with my finances." The AI reads a router that tells it how to assess your situation, picks the right analysis module, and walks you through it.</p>

<p>No app. No account. No subscription. No server. Your data never leaves your computer.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The system has three layers:</p>

<p><strong>1. A router</strong> that the AI reads at the start of every session. It contains intake questions, a decision tree for which module to load next, rules for tone and privacy, and state management via a local JSON file. The router is the brain.</p>

<p><strong>2. Eighteen modules</strong> organized into five phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Audit</strong> — spending analysis, income breakdown, net worth calculation</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> — emergency fund, debt payoff, tax withholding gaps, unclaimed benefits</li>
<li><strong>Optimize</strong> — pre-tax vs Roth, mega backdoor, portfolio concentration, equity compensation</li>
<li><strong>Plan</strong> — goal quantification, savings waterfall, 529 strategy</li>
<li><strong>Act</strong> — ranked action items with dollar impact per hour of effort</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. A data ladder</strong> that progressively unlocks deeper analysis as you share more information. Level 0 is conversation only (no files needed). Level 2 is a credit card CSV. Level 3 is a pay stub. Each level produces useful output. You stop whenever you're comfortable.</p>

<h3>What makes it different</h3>

<p><strong>Fix the present before planning the future.</strong> Most financial planning starts with "what's your retirement number?" Open Plan starts with "are you leaving money on the table right now?" A missed 401k match or RSU withholding gap costs more than a suboptimal asset allocation.</p>

<p><strong>Budget is an output, not an input.</strong> You don't set a budget and try to stick to it. You set goals, compute required savings, and the spending ceiling falls out of the math. The budget is what's left over.</p>

<p><strong>Each dollar decides for itself.</strong> The pre-tax vs Roth question reduces to one inequality: is your marginal rate now higher than your effective rate in retirement? If yes, pre-tax wins. No forecasting required. Each dollar you earn today can make the optimal choice independently.</p>

<p><strong>Start anywhere, go deeper.</strong> There's no required sequence. The router picks the highest-impact module for your situation. If you have credit card debt, it starts there. If you're leaving employer match on the table, it starts there. The system finds the biggest leak first.</p>

<h3>The zero-data path</h3>

<p>The most important design decision: Open Plan works with no data at all. The quick-start module asks five or six conversational questions (rough income, rough spending, age, do you get a 401k match?) and produces a first-pass savings waterfall from verbal estimates alone.</p>

<p>This matters because the biggest barrier to financial planning isn't complexity. It's activation energy. If someone has to go download three CSVs before they see any value, they'll never start. Open Plan delivers an actionable insight in five minutes with zero files. Then it says: "Want to go deeper? Here's exactly which file to grab next."</p>

<h3>The tech</h3>

<p>The system was built using a <a href="/writing/2026/02/sub-agent-trees.html">sub-agent tree</a>: 22 AI agents across three providers (OpenAI, Google, xAI) wrote all 18 modules in parallel in 2 minutes. Three independent models reviewed the output. A reconciliation agent applied consensus fixes. Total build time from blueprint to verified v1: about 8 minutes.</p>

<p>The modules themselves are plain markdown with YAML frontmatter. Each declares its prerequisites, required data level, output artifacts, and completion signal. The router reads these declarations to manage session flow. There's no code, no database, no API. The AI is the runtime.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>If you use a cloud AI (Claude, ChatGPT), your financial data goes through their servers. That's the honest truth, and the router tells users this up front.</p>

<p>If you care about privacy, run it with a local model. The modules are just text. Any model that can follow instructions can run them. A 70B parameter model on a Mac with 64GB of RAM handles it fine.</p>

<p>Either way, your data stays in your folder. There's no server, no telemetry, no account. Delete the folder and it's gone.</p>

<h3>What it's not</h3>

<p>Open Plan is not financial advice. It's a structured way to think about your money, powered by whatever AI you already use. The system includes disclaimers and uncertainty protocols. When it doesn't have enough information, it says so. When a question requires a professional (estate planning, tax filing, insurance), it says that too.</p>

<p>It's also not a product. There's no company behind it, no monetization plan, no premium tier. It's an open-source experiment in whether the right prompt architecture can replace a $5,000/year financial advisor for the 90% of cases that are straightforward.</p>
