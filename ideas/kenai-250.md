# Kenai 250 — June 2026

## What It Is

The Kenai 250 is a free, fully unsupported bikepacking race on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. ~265 miles of singletrack, gravel, and road. ~30,000 feet of climbing. Starts and ends in Hope, AK — a town of 200 people, 85 miles south of Anchorage. The course links Resurrection Pass, Russian Lakes, Lost Lake, Johnson Pass, and more. Bears, moose, river crossings, fog, rain, and 22 hours of daylight.

You carry everything. No outside support. No pre-arranged food drops. Ghost riders allowed on high bear-density trails. The fastest riders finish in under 36 hours. Most take 2–3 days. Registration is free. SPOT/InReach tracker encouraged.

## Dates & Registration

The 2025 edition started June 20 (Friday, 9:00 AM). Expect 2026 to fall on the same solstice weekend — likely **June 19 or 20, 2026**. Registration opens on the [Kenai 250 site](https://kenai250.wordpress.com/) and fills fast. Watch for announcements in early spring. Cost: free.

## ⚠️ Timing Conflict: IRONMAN Nice — June 28, 2026

If Kenai starts June 19–20 and you finish in 2–3 days (June 21–22), you have **6–7 days** before IRONMAN Nice. That's tight but possible — if you fly direct from Anchorage and accept compromised race-week prep. The real risk: a mechanical, bad weather, or injury extends Kenai to 4+ days and destroys your Nice taper. Decide which race is the A race. If it's Nice, treat Kenai as an adventure ride and cap your effort.

## Logistics from San Francisco

- **Fly:** SFO → ANC (Anchorage). Direct flights on Alaska Airlines, ~5 hours. Book early for solstice week.
- **Drive:** Rent a car in Anchorage. 85 miles south on the Seward Highway to Hope. ~2 hours.
- **Bike:** Ship ahead or fly with a bike bag. No bike shops in Hope.
- **Lodging:** Hope has a few cabins and a campground. Anchorage has full services. Arrive a day early.
- **Return flight to Nice:** ANC → SFO → NCE, or ANC → SEA → NCE. Book flexible tickets.

## Gear (You Know This)

- Full-suspension or hardtail, 27.5+ tires, dropper post
- Bikepacking bags (frame, seat, handlebar, top tube)
- Bivy or ultralight shelter — nights are cool, rain is likely
- Warm-when-wet layers: merino base, synthetic insulation, rain shell
- Bear spray (mandatory common sense)
- InReach or SPOT tracker
- Repair kit: tubes, tire plugs, multi-tool, chain links, derailleur hanger
- 2–3 days of food; resupply possible in Cooper Landing and Seward
- Water filter (water is abundant on the peninsula)
- Lights optional — solstice means near-continuous daylight

## Training Considerations

You've done this before. Focus on:

- **Back-to-back long days** on mixed terrain — singletrack endurance, not just road miles
- **Night riding** if you plan to push through (even with long daylight, fog and fatigue blur the line)
- **Hike-a-bike fitness** — steep grades require walking; strong legs help
- **Taper carefully** — if racing Nice 8 days later, treat Kenai as a hard training block and begin Nice taper immediately after
- **Don't blow up at Kenai.** Ride steady. Save something for France.
