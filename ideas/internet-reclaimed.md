# Internet Reclaimed

## Thesis

Host everything on your own website and local files. Own your data. Own your presence. The internet you were promised still exists — you just have to build it.

## The Problem

You rent your identity from corporations. Your words live on their servers. Your audience exists at their mercy. One policy change, one acquisition, one shutdown — and your digital life vanishes.

Twitter can silence you. Medium can paywall you. Google can delete you. You built nothing. You own nothing.

## The Argument

**The internet is a protocol, not a platform.** Protocols are open. Platforms are prisons. Somewhere we forgot the difference.

I built the stack from scratch — TCP/IP, QUIC, HTTP/3, BGP, BBR, Protocol Buffers, an audio modem. Not to prove a point. To understand what we gave away. The internet is simple. A machine talks to a machine. No middleman required.

**Plain HTML still works.** My site runs on GitHub Pages. Static files. No framework, no build step, no database. It loads fast. It will outlast every React app deployed this year. The web was built for documents. Documents don't need JavaScript.

**Nostr fixes identity.** A cryptographic keypair is your identity. No company grants it. No company revokes it. You sign your posts. Relays carry them. If one relay dies, others remain. Your identity travels with you because it belongs to you.

## The Indie Web Principles

1. **Own your domain.** It is your address on the internet. Everything else is a forwarding service.
2. **Publish on your site first.** Syndicate elsewhere if you want reach. But the canonical copy lives on your ground.
3. **Keep local copies.** Files on your disk survive every cloud shutdown. Plain text outlasts every format.
4. **Use open protocols.** RSS, Atom, Nostr, ActivityPub. Standards outlive startups.
5. **Build for durability.** A static HTML page from 1997 still renders. Your Notion workspace won't.

## The Self-Hosting Philosophy

You don't need permission to publish. You need a text editor, a domain, and twenty minutes. The tools exist. They always existed. We just stopped using them.

Self-hosting is not nostalgia. It is resilience. When you control the server, you control the terms. No ads. No tracking. No algorithmic feed deciding who sees your work.

## What I Do

- Write in plain text files, stored locally.
- Publish HTML to my own domain.
- Use Nostr for identity and short-form posts.
- Syndicate to platforms when useful, never as primary.
- Keep everything versioned in Git.

## The Call

Stop renting. Start owning. The internet was designed for this. Every protocol in the stack assumes decentralization. We centralized it by choice. We can reverse that choice today.

Write a blog post. Buy a domain. Push some HTML. The tools are free. The protocols are open. The internet is yours if you take it back.
