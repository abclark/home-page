# Alaska Backcountry Skiing

## The Zones

**Valdez / Thompson Pass.** The capital of Alaska heli-skiing. The Chugach Mountains above Valdez receive 600+ inches of snow annually. Thompson Pass, 26 miles east of town, offers steep couloirs, spines, and massive vertical — 3,000 to 5,000 feet per run. This is the marquee destination. Maritime snowpack means dense, stable powder. The terrain suits advanced skiers, though operators accommodate intermediates.

**Haines.** Quieter, cheaper, wilder. The Chilkat Range delivers steep coastal terrain with fewer crowds. Southeast Alaska's maritime climate brings heavy snowfall. Haines draws skiers who want big lines without the Valdez price tag. Fewer operators mean more solitude.

**Turnagain Pass.** The touring mecca. Thirty minutes south of Girdwood on the Seward Highway, Turnagain offers accessible backcountry without a helicopter. Skin up, ski down. Terrain ranges from mellow glades to steep chutes. Popular with Anchorage locals. Free. The trade-off: avalanche terrain demands respect and education.

## Heli vs. Touring

Heli-skiing buys vertical. A strong day yields 15,000–25,000 feet of descents. You reach terrain no bootpack touches. Cost: $1,200–$1,800 per day, or $8,000–$14,000 for a week-long package with lodging and meals.

Touring costs nothing beyond gear. You earn every foot. A big day yields 4,000–6,000 vertical feet. Turnagain Pass and Thompson Pass both offer excellent touring. You need avalanche training (AIARE Level 1 minimum), a beacon, probe, shovel, and fitness.

Do both. Tour Turnagain for a few days, then fly in Valdez.

## Timing

**March through mid-April.** Days lengthen. Snowpack stabilizes. Temperatures hover around freezing, producing consistent powder or spring corn. Late February works but brings shorter days and colder temps. By May, conditions deteriorate at lower elevations.

The sweet spot: last two weeks of March.

## Rough Cost

| Component | Estimate |
|---|---|
| SFO → ANC round trip | $300–$500 |
| Rental car (1 week) | $400–$600 |
| Heli week (Valdez, all-in) | $8,000–$14,000 |
| Touring week (self-guided) | $500–$1,000 |
| Mixed trip (3 days heli + touring) | $5,000–$7,000 |

## Logistics from San Francisco

Fly SFO to Anchorage (ANC). Direct flights exist on Alaska Airlines, ~5 hours. Rent a car at ANC. Drive to Turnagain Pass (1 hour south), Girdwood (45 min), or Valdez (5.5 hours east via the Richardson Highway — check road conditions). For Haines, fly ANC to Juneau, then a short prop to Haines, or take the fast ferry.

Book heli packages 6–12 months ahead. March fills fast. Bring your own avalanche gear or rent in Anchorage at AMH or REI.

Pack for cold. Expect 10°F to 35°F. Wind matters more than temperature.
