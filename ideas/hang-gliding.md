# Hang Gliding at Point of the Mountain — Draper, Utah

## What It Is

Point of the Mountain sits between Draper and Lehi, 25 miles south of Salt Lake City. Two ridges face opposite directions, catching wind from nearly every angle. This makes it one of the most consistent flying sites in the world. Pilots fly here 300+ days a year. Several schools operate on-site, offering lessons from first flight to full certification.

## The Schools

Two main hang gliding schools operate at the Point:

- **Wasatch Hang Gliding** — USHPA-certified, the primary hang gliding school
- **Birdman Academy** — hang gliding and paragliding lessons and tandems

Both include equipment (glider, harness, helmet) with instruction.

## What You Learn

Training follows a progressive model. Day one: equipment setup, ground handling, basic controls, then short flights at running height. You advance up the hill as skill permits. Most students fly a few feet off the ground on their first lesson. Over time you progress through turns, landing approaches, and eventually soaring from the 275-foot ridge top. Ground school covers weather, wind patterns, terrain interaction, and preflight inspection.

A full course to Hang 2 (novice rating, fly unsupervised) takes roughly 20 lessons.

## Cost

| Package | Price | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| Single lesson (half day) | $150 | Solo instruction, all equipment |
| Intro package | $340 | One lesson + tandem flight |
| Fledgling (5 lessons) | $650 | 5 half-day lessons, 2 ground schools |
| Wings over Wasatch (full H2 course) | $2,400 | 20 lessons, 5 ground schools, manual |
| Team Pilot (unlimited + equipment) | $2,000 + gear | Unlimited lessons, all equipment included |

Tandem flights alone cost $220. Prices from Wasatch Hang Gliding; Birdman Academy charges similar rates.

## Winter Availability

Yes. The Point flies year-round. Winter thermals are weaker, but ridge lift still works. Schools operate by appointment, not by season. Dress warm — expect 20–40°F on the hill from December through February. Call ahead to confirm weather-dependent scheduling.

## Duration

A single lesson runs a half day (3–4 hours). The full H2 certification takes 20 sessions spread over weeks or months, depending on weather and your schedule. An intensive trip of 5–7 days could cover 5–10 lessons.

## Logistics from San Francisco
