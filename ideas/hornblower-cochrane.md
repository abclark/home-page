# Hornblower & Cochrane: A Listening Plan

## The Hornblower Series

C.S. Forester wrote eleven novels following Horatio Hornblower from midshipman to admiral. Read them in chronological order:

1. *Mr. Midshipman Hornblower* (1950)
2. *Lieutenant Hornblower* (1952)
3. *Hornblower and the Hotspur* (1962)
4. *Hornblower and the Crisis* (1967, unfinished)
5. *Hornblower and the Atropos* (1953)
6. *The Happy Return* (1937) — US title: *Beat to Quarters*
7. *A Ship of the Line* (1938)
8. *Flying Colours* (1938)
9. *The Commodore* (1945)
10. *Lord Hornblower* (1946)
11. *Admiral Hornblower in the West Indies* (1958)

Some readers skip *Crisis* (it breaks mid-sentence) and return to it last. Either way works.

## Audiobooks: The Definitive Recordings

**Christian Rodska** narrates the complete series unabridged for Audible Studios. He is the gold standard. His Hornblower is clipped, anxious, self-doubting — exactly right. Every book is available on Audible.

An older abridged set narrated by **Michael Jayston** exists but is harder to find. Stick with Rodska.

**Where to get them:**

- **Audible** — All eleven titles. One credit per book, or buy the series outright.
- **Libby / OverDrive** — Availability varies by library system. Many carry the Rodska recordings. Check your local library's digital catalog. Worth a hold request if not immediately available.
- **Libro.fm** — Supports independent bookstores. Same recordings.

## Thomas Cochrane: The Real Hornblower

Admiral Lord Cochrane (1775–1860) commanded a small frigate and terrorized the French, Spanish, and anyone else the Admiralty pointed him at. He was court-martialed, struck from the Navy, fled to Chile and Brazil to lead their navies, then returned to Britain and was reinstated. Forester, Patrick O'Brian, and others all drew from his life.

### Key Books

**His own account:**

- **_The Autobiography of a Seaman_** (1860) — Cochrane's memoir in two volumes. Vivid, self-serving, indispensable. Available as a free audiobook on LibriVox (narrated by Timothy Ferguson). Also on Google Play, Kobo, and Everand. Kindle editions cost little or nothing — the text is public domain.

**The best biography:**

- **_Cochrane the Dauntless_** by David Cordingly (2007) — The definitive modern biography. Cordingly did original archival research and writes with pace. Available in Kindle and print. No widely available audiobook as of this writing — check Audible and Libby periodically.

**Also worth reading:**

- **_The Sea Wolf_** by Ben Wilson (2023) — A recent, well-reviewed biography. Available on Kindle and Audible.
- **_Lord Cochrane: Seaman, Radical, Liberator_** by Christopher Lloyd (1947) — The classic short biography. Out of print but findable used or via Internet Archive.

## The Plan

Listen to Hornblower first. Then read Cochrane and see where Forester got his plots. The autobiography is free. The fiction costs a credit a book. Both are worth every hour.
